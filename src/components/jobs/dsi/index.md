I was brought on to implement their first set of web apps to allow clients to access our databases. I used a standard <mark>ASP.NET</mark> stack using <mark>C#</mark> to do any manipulations or anything that couldn't be done with Javascript. I also utilized the <mark>DevExpress</mark> libraries to bring features like graphs and pivot tables to let users have more control to see what they were trying to see.
