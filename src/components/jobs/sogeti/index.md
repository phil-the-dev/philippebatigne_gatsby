<em><small>Informatica Developer/Tester at T. Rowe Price: July 2017 - Present</small></em><br/>
I rigorously test other <mark>Informatica</mark> Developers' mappings and workflows using hand written <mark>SQL</mark> scripts to make sure they followed the technical specifications as the client specified. I also learned Informatica to create and run my own <mark>ETL</mark> mappings and workflows that complied with the technical specifications given by the client.

<em><small>Windows Application Developer at Procter & Gamble: May 2017 - July 2017</small></em><br/>
 I created small <mark>WinForms</mark> programs in <mark>C#</mark> and <mark>.NET</mark> to both A) scrape data from certain word documents and compile into a single Excel Spreadsheet and B) pull certain word and pdf documents from a shared drive. Both were part of a data migration effort and for internal use only.

<em><small>Web Developer at ConnectYourCare: June 2015 - May 2017</small></em><br/>
I worked on their massive healthcare portal implementing client requested features, building out new functionality, and tackling their backlog of bugs. I worked with <mark>Git</mark> to check in all my code and scripts, an <mark>Oracle</mark> database for creating/modifying tables, <mark>Java</mark> for all the backend work, and <mark>Javascript/CSS/HTML</mark> for the frontend. I also reworked the majority of the main portal to make it more <mark>508 Compliant</mark>. I also followed <mark>design guidelines</mark> that I later documented. I worked in an <mark>Agile</mark> workflow/SDLC with one-month sprints where I worked closely with a team that comprised of a Business Associate and a Tester.
