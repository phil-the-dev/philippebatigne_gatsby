I'm the main developer for a <mark>Ruby on Rails</mark> web app called <a href="https://viewspace.org">ViewSpace</a>. I help with the product owners and stakeholders to build out features and create workable solutions to their problems. I also semi-project manage the project with the product owner since there is no central project manager role. The web app uses <mark>Bootstrap 3</mark> to create all the views that are written in <mark>HAML</mark>. I use <mark>JavaScript</mark> and <mark>jQuery</mark> as well for most of the front end interactions, along with some <mark>CSS3</mark> transtitions to make the site snappy and snazzy. I'm also using <mark>capybara</mark> to write tests for my models, views, and overall functionality.
